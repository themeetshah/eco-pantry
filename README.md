# Recipe Management Application

## Hack-NU-Thon 6.0 | Nirma University

This project is developed as part of the Hack-NU-Thon 6.0 at Nirma University. It is a **Smart Kitchen Application** that helps users discover recipes based on ingredients they already have. The platform provides a personalized recipe generation service, enabling users to explore different cuisines and easily prepare meals with the ingredients in their inventory.

As the team leader, I am proud to present this solution built with modern web technologies like React, TypeScript, and integrated with APIs to offer a seamless cooking experience.
